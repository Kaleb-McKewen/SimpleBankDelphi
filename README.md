# SimpleBankDelphi
Simple Bank Server written in Pascal using Delphi. DUnitX was used for testing, a test driven development methodology was used.

## Info
The simple bank server allows for bank accounts to be created, deposited to, withdrawn from and creating a simple transaction list.
The repository contains two pascal units, one that contains the bank unit and one for testing using DUnitX.
FastMM5 was also used to detect memory leaks. The files were developed within a project group.
Below is a UML diagram to convey the structure of the classes and their relationships using Object Orientated Programming.
With future features such as different accounts I would switch to an interface for a generic account with sub classes for each type of account.

## Reflection
This was my first time programming using Pascal as well as using Delphi.
The test driven development methodology helped with early bug finds and creating a clear goal for each feature.
